  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I work with digital video and creating graphic art. The subject matter I lean to work with vary from creating interesting graphics to recording skateboarding videos. My main goal is to spark interest through my work and make people think about the subject in front of them. I want anyone and everyone to be able to view my work.</p>

<p>Approaching any idea, I try to stray away from being too serious as I feel the lighter aspect of any subject is much more compelling. Editing a video and warping the perspective to give it a more personal feel is an idea that I like to play with and currently developing. When it comes to my art, my main motive is to create an idea I can have fun with, whether it'd be playing with logos to editing whatever I can get my hands on. </p>
