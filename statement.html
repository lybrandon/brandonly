  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I work with digital video and creating graphic art. The subject matter I lean to work with vary from skateboarding clips to creating interesting graphics. My main goal is to spark interest through my work and make people think about the subject at hand.</p>

<p>Editing a video and warping the perspective to give it a more personal feel is an idea that I like to play with. When it comes to graphic art, my main motive is to create an idea I can have fun with, whether it'd be playing with logos to editing celebrities faces.
