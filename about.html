    <!-- <h3 style="text-align:left;">About Me</h3>
    <p>
     I am a digital media student at San Jose State University. I was born in San Diego but was raised all over the Bay Area. I migrated up down California till finally settling back home in San Jose.  I originally pursued Graphic Design but by chance, I switched over to Digital Media when transferring to state and never looked back. At SJSU, I’ve learned to work with multiple mediums such as video editing, 3d design, coding and many more. My bread and butter lay in my illustrations but I’ve learned to incorporate my personal style to the task at hand. My interest currently shifted from 2D to 3D and am in the process of learning new programs such as Blender, After Effects, and Procreate.

    <p>
      I enjoy drawing. At a young age, I began drawing illustrations on paper which later translated into creating digital work. Through different mediums, I am able to develop characters and stories to push my inner thoughts on to a screen. Illustrations have been the driving inspiration behind most of my work. Drawing has lead me to pursue an interesting path that encourages me to stay resilient and trust the process.
